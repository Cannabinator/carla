# Science / model changelog

Every change that can alter results gets an entry with before/after numbers.
Pure refactors (bit-identical outputs) are listed only as such.

## Phase 0 — baseline (2026-10-09, branch `claude/refactor-handoff`, base `29bca10`)

Pure refactor, no behaviour change:
- `carla` is imported lazily (`TYPE_CHECKING` / inside functions) in
  `src/v2v/network_enhanced.py`, `src/visualization/lidar/collector.py`,
  `src/visualization/lidar/api.py`; `src/utils/__init__.py` exports are lazy (PEP 562).
- Added `pytest.ini` with the `carla` marker.

Test baseline without `carla` installed (`pytest tests/v2v tests/v2x tests/test_v2v_neighbor_discovery.py tests/test_v2v_lidar.py tests/test_lidar_api.py -m "not carla"`):
187 passed, 8 skipped, 5 xfailed (strict).

Known-stale tests, now `xfail(strict=True)` (REFACTOR_HANDOFF §3.5):
- `tests/test_v2v_neighbor_discovery.py` (3): inject BSMs without `broadcast_all()`.
- `tests/v2v/test_v2v_basic.py::test_scalability_100_vehicles_all_neighbors`,
  `tests/v2v/test_scientific_integrity.py::test_cumulative_avg_neighbors_converges`:
  assume lossless delivery, but the CSMA term drops packets at N=100.

Golden tests added (`tests/golden/`, regenerate only deliberately with `UPDATE_GOLDEN=1`):
- `DSRCChannel`, seed 42, 5 consecutive ticks: 2-vehicle pairs (30/250/400 m), 10-vehicle line
  (NLOS blockers, with and without the NLOS model), 50- and 100-vehicle grids.
- `create_bsm_from_carla` with a mock snapshot (normal, and braking/reverse ambulance).
- These pin current behaviour including known defects (S2 yaw rate, S8 x/y in lat/lon fields).
- `test_scientific_fixes.py` (root, asserted nothing) replaced by `tests/unit/test_scientific_fixes.py`
  with real asserts; its pothole test is dropped (D1: pothole code is to be deleted).

Not yet run: modules slated for deletion (`test_complete_system`, `test_frontend*`,
`test_reproducibility`), which need a live server, Selenium or `websocket`.

## Phase 1 — repo cleanup (2026-10-10, no behaviour change in the V2X/DSRC models)

- Removed the monolithic/V2V plane: `src/scenarios`, `src/agents`, `src/lidar`, `src/web`,
  `src/visualization/lidar/{server,api}.py`, `src/v2v/{api.py,dashboard.html}`, all of `src/utils`
  except `binary_protocol.py`, six plane-A HTML pages, spare logo variants, legacy shell scripts,
  `docs/V2V_API_REFERENCE.md`, and the plane-A / Selenium / live-server tests.
- D1 (default): pothole code, README section and `scripts/lidar_pothole_detection_check.py` removed.
- New `src/server/app.py` holds the app wiring (`/`, `/admin`, `/client`, routers, `/assets`);
  `start_server.py` imports from it.
- Removed unused requirements (selenium, open3d, opencv-python, matplotlib, pandas).
- `docker-compose.yml` reads `ADMIN_TOKEN` from `.env` (`.env.example` added).
- Tests split per handoff §3.5: protocol/collector-schema cases moved to
  `tests/unit/test_lidar_protocol.py`; DENM/CAM endpoint tests, `ConnectionManager` tests and
  `LiDARStreamingAPI` tests dropped with their code.
- Test result without `carla`: 161 passed, 8 skipped, 5 xfailed.
- Not done yet from the Phase 1 list: `pyproject.toml`, ruff, pyright, pre-commit.

## Server tests (2026-10-10, no model change)

- `tests/contract/` (53 tests, no CARLA): the real FastAPI app with a `FakeWorld` that uses the
  real `SessionManager`. Pages, admin auth (missing/wrong/unconfigured token), join -> telemetry
  -> leave, kick, WebSocket telemetry/ping/expiry/disconnect cleanup, traffic/pedestrian
  endpoints, request validation. Mutation-checked: breaking auth or `leave` makes them fail.
- `tests/server/` (marker `server`, skipped without `SERVER_URL`): the same life cycle against a
  RUNNING server over real HTTP/WebSocket. Needs `SERVER_URL`, `ADMIN_TOKEN`; simulation tests
  (marker `carla`) also use `CARLA_HOST`/`CARLA_PORT` and connect the server if it is idle.
- Measured against the real app code path with a fake world: telemetry WebSocket rate 2.48 Hz
  (documented 5 Hz) - confirms handoff defect C6. Not yet verified against live CARLA.

## Phase 1 tooling (2026-10-10, no model change)

- `pyproject.toml` (deps, extras `dev`/`analysis`, ruff config), `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
  (ruff on commit, offline pytest on push), `pyrightconfig.json` (basic mode on `src/` and
  `start_server.py`).
- Ruff (`E9`,`F`) clean: removed 36 unused imports and unused variables. Rule set is
  deliberately conservative; widen during the restructuring.
- Pyright basic: 0 errors. `reportOptionalMemberAccess` is switched off in the three server files
  (42 findings from module-global/None-initialised state) until Phase 2 replaces that design.
- Test fix: `test_different_seeds_may_differ` computed `all_same` but asserted nothing, so it could
  never fail; it now asserts (seeds 1 and 999 give different delivery sets, deterministic).
- `vulture` (confidence 80): one hit, the unused `sensor_data` parameter of `V2VNetworkEnhanced.enable_bidirectional_sharing` (nothing calls it; goes away with the Phase 3 network merge). Every remaining source file is imported somewhere.
- Still open from Phase 1: live smoke test by a human (admin connect -> client join -> telemetry; `tests/server` covers it when pointed at a live server); archive tag push (HTTP 403 from this environment).

## Phase 2 - single simulation thread (2026-10-10, behaviour-preserving architecture change)

No V2X/channel model change (golden tests unchanged). Fixes handoff defects:
- C1/C2/C3/C4/C5: only the "carla-tick" thread calls CARLA after `start()`. Handlers use
  `world.submit(fn)` (`SimThreadExecutor`) and await the result off the event loop. All
  `apply_batch_sync` calls use `do_tick=False`; the one explicit tick (pedestrian controllers)
  goes through `_tick()`. Mutating methods raise if called from another thread.
- C1: `_frame` is CARLA's own frame id (previously a counter that drifted with foreign ticks).
- C10: telemetry (per frame) and the per-client V2X payload (per V2X update) are published by the
  sim thread, stamped with the snapshot frame (+ `sim_time`); readers make no RPC.
- C6: separate receive task, no double wait. Measured telemetry WebSocket rate 2.48 Hz -> 4.97 Hz
  (target 5 Hz) with the real app on a recording `carla` stub. Not yet measured on live CARLA.
- C8: spawn points / blueprints use a seeded `random.Random(config.seed)` (was unseeded global).
- C9: `WorldConfig` (pydantic, cross-field validation: substepping rule, tm_port clashes, whole-frame
  V2X rate). Defaults reproduce earlier behaviour, including `global_speed_pct = -20.0` (20 % FASTER
  than the limit) which contradicts `src/config.py` ("30 % slower"); contradiction recorded, not changed.
- C12: `/admin/connect` validates the config (422), rejects a concurrent connect (409), and reports
  `connect_state` / `connect_error` in `/admin/status`.
- C13: timezone-aware datetimes; `SessionManager` has a lock.
- Robustness (new): an exception in the V2X update or session expiry is logged and the simulation
  keeps ticking (previously any non-RuntimeError ended the tick thread and destroyed all actors).
- V2X update gate is now `frame - last >= every_n` (was `frame % 10`), so extra ticks cannot skip it.
  The second, time-based gate inside the network (defect C7) is Phase 3.
- LiDAR collector cleanup now runs on the sim thread (was a helper thread making CARLA calls); its
  internal `time.sleep(0.1)` (L9) briefly stalls the tick loop when a LiDAR session ends (Phase 4).
- Verification: stub-`carla` tests record the calling thread of every CARLA call (before: 33 of 38
  calls off-thread, 4 batches ticked implicitly, frame 6 vs real 11; after: 0, 0, equal). Mutation
  checks confirm the tests fail if `do_tick=True` or the thread guard is restored.
- NOT verified against a real CARLA server: that actors spawned by `apply_batch_sync(..., False)` are
  visible to `world.get_actor` before the next tick, and that destroy batches without a tick behave.
  TODO(verify) - run `tests/server` with CARLA_HOST/CARLA_PORT (traffic/pedestrian/join tests).

## Phase 3, step 1 - structure (2026-10-10, PURE REFACTOR: outputs bit-identical)

Proof: the golden tests (DSRCChannel seed 42, 7 scenarios x 5 ticks; BSM extraction x 2) pass unchanged.
For the BSM field rename the golden files were compared after renaming the keys: values identical.
- `src/v2v/` deleted. One `V2XNetwork` class (was `V2VNetworkEnhanced` + subclass `V2XNetworkEnhanced`):
  the subclass's `update()` wrapped the base `update()`; the base is now `_update_bsm()` and the public
  `update()` calls it, then the RSU/VRU parts. Same order of operations.
- Messages split (verbatim copy by AST range) into `v2x/messages/{bsm,cam,denm,map,spat,cpm,vruam}.py`,
  plus `v2x/extract.py` (the only CARLA-reading module), `v2x/threat.py`, `v2x/constants.py`.
  `V2VEnhancedMessage` -> `EnhancedBSMMessage`; `V2V_RANGE_*` -> `RANGE_*_M`.
- Channel moved to `v2x/channel/dsrc_logdistance.py`. Duplicate `DSRCConfig` (and the whole of
  `src/config.py`, otherwise unused) deleted; fields and defaults were identical.
- S8: BSM `latitude/longitude/elevation` -> `x_m/y_m/z_m` (they always held CARLA metres).
- Tests consolidated into `tests/v2x/` (not `tests/unit/v2x/` as the handoff suggests, to keep the
  relative paths used by several files); `v2v` removed from names.
- Behaviour fix (not a model change): the admin page sent `v2v_range`/`v2v_enabled` while the server
  reads `v2x_range`/`v2x_enabled`, so the range box was silently ignored (always 75 m, V2X on). The page
  now sends the right keys.
- Left as is: docker container/network names (`carla-v2v-*`) so existing deployments are unaffected;
  stale `docs/agents/*` and `.instructions.md` (replaced in Phase 8); `.gitignore` entries.

## Phase 3, model change S2 - BSM yaw rate (2026-10-10)

`create_bsm_from_carla` applied `math.degrees()` to `get_angular_velocity().z`, but CARLA already
returns deg/s, so `yaw_rate` was inflated by 57.3x.
- Before: input angular velocity z = 0.5 -> `yaw_rate` = 28.64788975654116
- After:  input angular velocity z = 0.5 -> `yaw_rate` = 0.5
- Golden diff: only `yaw_rate` in `bsm_from_snapshot` and `bsm_braking_reverse`; channel goldens unchanged
  (the channel does not use yaw rate). No other consumer of `yaw_rate` exists in the code.
- TODO(verify): the unit rests on the CARLA 0.9.16 API reference (deg/s); confirm with a live yaw test.
